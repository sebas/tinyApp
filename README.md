# TinyApp: the best URL shortener on the universe

## Problem Statement

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Given a URL TinyApp will provide you with a shorten version of it and a URL that redirects to the original URL.

It is super fast.

You'll find that we're using the PUT and DELETE methods.
